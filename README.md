# Open Source Search Engine

A basic tool that finds documents based on simple logic-structured queries.

## Getting started

To run this project you'll need Python 3.6.9 an Ubuntu 18.04.
You'll need the next python packages
```
bitstring==3.1.6
wxPython==4.0.7.post2
```
The installer will try to download the above packages.

### Installing
Clone the project:
 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/RazorBest/CDL-Open-Source-Search-Engine
 
 ```
You can install Python from here: https://www.python.org/

#### Automatic installation
You can install the package with
```
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

#### Manual installation
If the script fails, you'll need to install the package manually with:
```
$ sudo -H pip3 install .
```
in the project directory.

After that, you'll need to install the dependecies.

You can install a package with pip like this:
```
$ pip3 install bitstring
```
  to install the latest version, or like this:
 ```
 $ pip3 install -Iv bitstring==3.1.6
 ```
  to install a specific version.
  
To install wxPython, use:
```
$ pip3 install -U -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-18.04/ wxPython
```
Or find the correpsonding wheel for your OS.
  
## How to use ossearch
To start the GUI, type "ossearch" in the terminal
```
$ ossearch
```
To start the shell, type
```
$ ossearch shell
```
### Using the shell
First time, you'll need to add a directory(or more) in which ossearch will look for queries:
```
>>> load example_docs
>>> load path/to/direcyoty
```
Next time you run shell, the directories will be already loaded. So you have to load a directory just once, if you don't modify it. Ossearch will keep the loaded data in $HOME/.ossearch_data

To list the loaded directories use:
```
>>> list
example_docs
path/to/directory
```

To remove a loaded directory use:
```
>>> remove example_docs
```

To search using a query use "search [query]":
```
>>> search linux && torvalds
```
You can always type "help" to see the available commands

### How construct a query

## Running the tests
To run a "test_file.py" use:
  ```
  python -m unittest tests/[test_file.py]
  
  ```
