Bretta is a beetle who has somehow lost hope for being rescued - she is used to being alone since everyone in town forgets about her and utterly mutters things to herself. After being rescued and found at the Fungal Wastes, she will move to her house in Dirtmouth.

However, if players choose to save Zote the Mighty at the Colosseum of Fools, Zote will move to Ditmouth where the two will meet, and Bretta immediately changes her perspective and somehow grows fond of Zote... Changing and showing all her dedications to Zote, instead of The Knight.
