Midwife is a black centipede looking being that is emerging from a wall, as her name implies she is a servant and midwife of The Nest. She claims that she can provide information that The Knight is looking for but later on opens up her mask revealing her mouth filled with sharp teeth and tries to eat The Knight. She doesn't take any damage from being hit but she inflicts damage on The Knight if you are caught in her attack - attacking her once will have hide back into her wall and will re-appear after re-entering the area, only this time she will apologize and will not attack.

    Location: Midwife Can be found behind a breakable wall at the end of a corridor at the bottom right exit of the Distant Village.
    Combat: Players may not kill Midwife.
